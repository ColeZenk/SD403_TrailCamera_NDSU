# Development Standards

## Code Organization
1. Modular file system - multiple concise files (<300 lines ideally), not monolithic main files
2. One file, one purpose - minimal global interfaces per file. **NO GLOBAL VARIABLES**
3. Proper file separation with corresponding headers

## Architecture Principles
- File-scope coupling: Static functions may be tightly integrated for performance
- Module-scope coupling: Loosely coupled between files via minimal interfaces
- Strong cohesion within modules
- No global variables - use proper encapsulation

## Documentation
- Document pin allocations and feature implementations
- Update relevant README.md or commit messages
- Headers on files for clarity
- Commit frequently

## Standards Compliance
- Adhere to Unix philosophy where applicable
- Follow C standards for embedded code
- Follow Verilog standards for FPGA code
- Follow Dart/Flutter standards for app development
- Use ESP-IDF and FreeRTOS best practices


## ESP32-CAM:
 - Capture, store, and pass images rapidly to ESP32-DEVKITV1

## ESP32-DEVKITV1:
  - Serve as intermediary between CAM and FPGA.
  - House (back end) edge ML model for motion prediction.
  - Manage stepper motor, RTC, and temperature/humidity sensor.
  - Manage pre-rendered backgrounds for TFT UI.

## Tang Nano 9K:

  - Manage TFT display interfacing.
  - Compress (pre-process) image streams to be transmitted via LoRa(UART).
  - House ML data lake (micro sd) for ESP32-DEVKITV1.
  - Manage low power watch dog system with PIR sensors.
  - Serve as a "smart IC" for extra pin needs (going to be connected in parallel bit transfer so this is needed)

## ESP32-S3 (WROOM):
  - Receive FFT coefficients.
  - House first daisy ML reconstruction mechanism.
  - Functionally serve as an API for iPhone.

## iPhone:
  - Final virtual user interface.
  - Polish and patch partitioned ML reconstructed image data.
  - On/Off, motor control, training en/dis.

# Relevant Standards and Practices
- Tightly [coupled](## Definitons) functions at static (file) scope
  - Simple and [composable](## Definitions)
- Loosely coupled functions when globally scoped
- Strong cohesion overall
- Use of ESP supported software components where possible
- Proper use of file seperation
  - Minimal global interfaces per file
  - One file has one purpose
- Proper use of [FreeRTOS](## Definitions)
